# 🌱 Sapling

Sapling is a calm, ritual-based focus app.

It’s built for people who want to work deliberately — without dashboards, streak pressure, or hustle culture.
Instead of optimizing productivity, Sapling focuses on **showing up**, **staying present**, and **letting effort grow quietly over time**.

## Why Sapling exists

Most productivity tools push urgency, metrics, and constant optimization.
Sapling takes a different approach.

Sapling believes:
- Focus should feel intentional, not stressful
- Rest is part of growth, not a failure
- Progress compounds quietly
- Missing days should never erase effort

Sapling is designed for students, creatives, and anyone tired of being rushed by their tools.

## Core Ideas

### 🌿 Focus as a Ritual
Work happens in calm focus cycles.
Longer sessions require rest — not as punishment, but as balance.

### 🌳 Growth, Not Streaks
Focus time becomes growth.
Growth appears gradually at milestones, avoiding constant feedback or pressure.
Nothing is ever taken away.

### 🌱 The Grove
Your grove represents accumulated effort.
Each tree reflects time you chose to focus.

### 🕯 Sanctuary
Sanctuary is a **one-time unlock** that preserves long-term history and growth.
It does not block core functionality.
It exists to protect memory, not to pressure users.

### 🤍 Ani
Ani is a quiet AI guide inside Sapling.
Ani helps with:
- clarifying what to work on
- breaking tasks into manageable steps
- answering study-related questions
- reflecting after focus sessions

Ani is intentionally restrained and never interrupts deep focus.

## What Sapling is *not*

- A productivity dashboard  
- A streak-based habit tracker  
- A gamified grind tool  
- A “maximize output” system  

Sapling is meant to feel slow, intentional, and humane.
