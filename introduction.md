# Sapling

Sapling is a calm, ritual-based focus app.

It is not designed to optimize productivity or push output.
Sapling exists to help you show up, focus deliberately, and let effort grow into something visible over time.

Instead of dashboards and streak pressure, Sapling uses:
- slow focus cycles
- intentional breaks
- visual growth as feedback
- language that encourages consistency without guilt

Sapling is built for students, creatives, and anyone who wants to work without burnout.

At its core, Sapling believes:
> Effort compounds quietly. Growth doesn’t need to be loud.

## Core Concepts

### Focus Cycles
You enter a focused session for a chosen duration.
Longer sessions require rest — not as punishment, but as part of growth.

### Growth
Focus time is converted into growth energy.
Growth appears at milestones, not constantly, to keep the experience calm and meaningful.

### The Grove
Your grove represents your accumulated effort.
Each tree reflects time you chose to focus.

### Sanctuary
Sanctuary is a one-time unlock that preserves long-term history and growth.
It does not block core focus functionality.
It exists to protect memory, not to pressure users.

Sapling is intentionally minimal.
If something feels noisy, it probably doesn’t belong.
